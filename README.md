Create custom post type and supporting metaboxes including image upload to save data to wp_postmeta.

The Old way
We use to write php to define our custom post type (or use ACF) and write code to display form metaboxesâ€¦ it would probably look something like this.

 - Write php to define our custom post type
 - Write php to define our custom taxonomies
 = Write php to structure our editing interface to utilize the new custom post type:
 - Register meta boxes (add_meta_boxes hook)
 - Create form callback
 - Write function to save the post meta (save_post hook)
 - Writing functionality for image galleries and file uploads would require additional functions to hook into thickbox / (javascript functions) to upload and save images and other file uploads.
